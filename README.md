# FSDA  (Flexible Statistics Data Analysis) MATLAB toolbox

The FSDA MATLAB Toolbox provides statisticians, engineers, scientists, researchers, and financial analysts with a comprehensive set of tools to assess and understand their data. FSDA Toolbox software includes functions and interactive tools for analyzing and modeling data, learning and teaching statistics.
You can grasp the main features from the short video http://rosa.unipr.it/fsda_video.html
More details about the latest release can be found at
http://rosa.unipr.it/FSDA/release_notes.html


## Getting Started 

You can start to familiarize with the FSDA toolbox in one of the following ways.

   A. Run the examples contained in files examples_regression.m or examples_multivariate.m or examples_categorical.m 
   Notice that all examples are organized in cells;
   
   B. Run the tutorials in the FSDA Matlab help pages;
   
   C. Watch the videos in the Examples section of the FSDA Matlab help pages
   
   D. Read section "Introduction to robust statistics" or "Technical introduction to Robust Statistics" in the FSDA Matlab help pages
   
   E. Read "Function reference page" in the FSDA Matlab help pages 

### Prerequisites 

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

To install FSDA it is necessary to run the file installFSDA.m
This file will:
1) copy all the HTML FSDA documentation file inside in the path (MATLAB docroot)/FSDA
2) Add a set folders to your MATLAB path (this can be done at any moment by running file addFSDA2path.m)
3) Launch buildocsearchdb in subfolder (FSDA root)/helpfiles/pointersHTML
4) Install the apps

## Running the tests

A list of files containing a series of examples associated to regression, multivariate analysis, clustering and the analysis of categorical data can be found at:

examples_regression.m (examples_regression.mlx)
examples_multivariate.m (examples_multivariate.mlx)
examples 
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
